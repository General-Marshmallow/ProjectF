the world contains the terrain, floors and tile layer
the floors consisting of a location, size and 1 material

there is just 1 "tile" layer
tiles can be passable or a wall
tiles use map coordinates
don't use chunks in this version


there is no "player" -

the World class contains static information about the world, for example it's rooms and their entities
a room object holds information about it's floor and tiles

be fucking considerate of code speed you dickwad
